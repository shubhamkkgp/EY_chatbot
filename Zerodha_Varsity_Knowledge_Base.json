The company also had a large exposure to copper futures on the London Metals Exchange (LME). Yasuo Hamanaka was Sumitomo’s chief ‘Copper Trader’.

At that point, he was probably the only man on the planet with so much copper. This meant he could control the prices of copper, quite literally.At the same time, he also bought Copper Futures at LME.Every trader knew that Yasuo Hamanaka was copper bull, but nobody knew the extent of his exposure (as LME wasn’t publishing open interest data at the time).Whenever traders or trading firms shorted copper, Hamanaka would buy. He could buy because Sumitomo was cash-rich and funded these trades.Since he bought in such large quantities, copper prices went up.Remember, copper is an international commodity, and the price is market-driven (LME futures).So LME prices went up – short traders were squeezed, Hamanaka made profits on futures.Short traders would eventually default, which meant they had to deliver copper upon expiry.Invariably these traders would end up buying copper from Sumitomo at a premium, which meant Sumitomo minted crisp profits on their spot position as well.The profits snowballed, and Yasuo Hamanaka became the undisputed king of copper."

Naturally, the prices started to cool off, and Yasuo Hamanaka started feeling the heat. His exposure was so large that it was difficult for him to offload the contracts (especially since he was doing most of the buying)! He went to the extent of borrowing funds to maintain his long positions. Remember, these were all leveraged positions, and when you have super large quantities of any leveraged positions, a small move against you can result in massive losses."

Wonderful Job Karthik, One doubt.. when i have done the Portfolio SD its coming 1.12% instend of 1.11%. You have mentioned the formula in ur excel file as “_xlfn.STDEV.P(R5:R130) didn’t understand this formula. What’s the problem if we give the formula stdev(R5:R130) which comes to 1.12.Awaiting the doubt to get cleared.Regards,Sonjoe JosephReplyKarthik Rangappasays:May 6, 2017 at 3:30 am‘=STDEV()’ is a excel function, behind which is the mathematical formula to calculate standard deviation. 1.12% is good, I guess minor decimal difference. Are you doing this on the same portfolio?ReplySONJOE JOSEPHsays:May 8, 2017 at 11:30 amYes i’m doing on the same portfolio.ReplyKarthik Rangappasays:May 9, 2017 at 3:19 amGood luck!ReplyAbhas singhsays:July 3, 2018 at 1:12 pmSir,I have tried the above exercises but I am facing a problem. The the result of STDEV which has been calculated here is nowhere matching my portfolio variance. Also, since the SD would anyway vary with the changing weight of each share, how would the Stdev. then always match the portfolio variance ? BTW I am not using the above portfolio, I have developed a portfolio of my own. AND a TON of thanks for creating such a great resource :-).ReplyKarthik Rangappasays:July 3, 2018 at 2:36 pmAbhas, if it’s a different portfolio, then the values will not match with what we have here. Btw, the portfolio variance won’t vary drastically on a day to day basis.ReplyJamessays:May 12, 2017 at 9:00 pmRespected Sir,Gratitude !!This module seems like a boon for (neophyte) Investors. Unfortunately, I categorize myself as a Trader (my trades range mainly 0-6 days or so). I understand that it is valuable for both Investors & Traders, depending upon one’s ability to retrieve useful info from data for one’s use. But, a novice like me would like to have some clarity of ‘Risk Management’ section from a Trader’s perspective as well. Also, I wonder if ‘Trading Psychology’ section of this Module will also throw some light on psychology of a trader.My experience –Few years ago, I was apprised by a broker to put orders at, say, 189.95 instead of 190, or at 150.05 instead of 150. Nothing technical, he told some pure psychological reason (do not remember now) leading to a special order picking behavior in market depth. Later I browsed a lot but couldn’t figure this out. I wonder if such psychological scenarios exist. If yes, will these be included in this module? Or please provide any reference/ books for such insights that one (otherwise) learns from one’s experience only.By the way –Graph of typos has been above its 20DMA for last 2-3 Modules. It has formed Bullish Marubozu in last two chapters consecutively. I guess it’s better to go Long on spell&grammar check tool, like Ginger, to crash such trends in few seconds. Sorry for pointing it out.–Coming soon in the awesome world of Zerodha 🙂 🙂–RegardsJamesReplyKarthik Rangappasays:May 13, 2017 at 5:48 amThanks pointing this out. I understand the grammar and typos – there are way too many. I’ll probably use one of thoes tools.Anyway, I too use figures like 189.95 instead of 190 – I’ve observed the fills are faster. As of now the module’s focus is risk management from portfolio perspective. Will soon shift to the traders perspective.ReplyJamessays:May 13, 2017 at 1:39 pmOhh !! Thanks a lot. I would be highly glad & obliged  to see more such (traders’) psychological tricks in this module so as to understand their mechanism insight – how these works. By the way, is/are there any book(s) for same??Question – You have described two methods of return calculation in excel —  ‘=ln(c3/c2)’ and ‘=c3/c2-1’. Which one is more practically preferable?Thanks in advanceBest RegardsReplyKarthik Rangappasays:May 14, 2017 at 5:10 amThere are are quite a few books on this topic, unable to think of one though. Will keep you posted.For more than 2 year of data, I’d suggest you take the ln returns, otherwise regular rt should be alright.ReplyJamessays:May 14, 2017 at 11:42 amThanks a lot.Karthik Rangappasays:May 15, 2017 at 1:31 amWelcome!"

I understand that it is valuable for both Investors & Traders, depending upon one’s ability to retrieve useful info from data for one’s use. But, a novice like me would like to have some clarity of ‘Risk Management’ section from a Trader’s perspective as well. Also, I wonder if ‘Trading Psychology’ section of this Module will also throw some light on psychology of a trader.My experience –Few years ago, I was apprised by a broker to put orders at, say, 189.95 instead of 190, or at 150.05 instead of 150. Nothing technical, he told some pure psychological reason (do not remember now) leading to a special order picking behavior in market depth. Later I browsed a lot but couldn’t figure this out. I wonder if such psychological scenarios exist. If yes, will these be included in this module? Or please provide any reference/ books for such insights that one (otherwise) learns from one’s experience only.By the way –Graph of typos has been above its 20DMA for last 2-3 Modules. It has formed Bullish Marubozu in last two chapters consecutively. I guess it’s better to go Long on spell&grammar check tool, like Ginger, to crash such trends in few seconds. Sorry for pointing it out.–Coming soon in the awesome world of Zerodha 🙂 🙂–RegardsJames"

Whilst an Institution has access to human resource (analyst), access to company management, financial database (such as Bloomberg, Reuters, Factset etc.), industry reports etc. So my objective here is to demonstrate how one can better understand a company and its business with the limited resources at hand.

Understanding the company and its business well gives you the required conviction to reason why it makes sense to stay invested in the stock even though the market may think otherwise. They say bear markets creates value, so if you have a high conviction on the company, you should consider buying into the stock during bear markets and not really selling the stock. Needless to say, this is highly counter-intuitive, and it takes years of investment practice to internalize this fact."

The thought process was that if countries traded and did business together, then they are less likely to wage war against each other.This laid the foundation for forming a bigger union called the ‘European Union’ (EU) with more European countries agreeing to join the EU.The EU formed a single market of sorts where goods, service, and people moved easily across countries. So much so that the EU decided to have its own currency called the ‘Euro’.The UK, although was a part of the EU, never accepted the Euro as their currency. Note there are many other countries in the EU which still have their own currency, example – Switzerland, Chez Republic, Denmark etc…There was a growing debate in the UK in recent times on whether the UK should remain in the EU. Many of UK’s citizens believed that the UK was better off outside the union as the rules laid out by the EU commission was more taxing on the UK’s citizen than actually benefiting them. In simpler words – they believe they would progress faster and better economically and as a society being outside the EU.Britain option toexitfrom the EU was called ‘Brexit’.The UK decided to formally seek its citizens’ vote on 23rdJune 2016, wherein the citizen would vote for being in or leaving the EU. This is called a ‘referendum.’The outcome of the referendum was a bit of shocker with the UK actually deciding to opt-out of the EU. In fact, many in the UK and the world believed that the UK would vote to stay in the EU."

After the market closes on Monday assume ABC Ltd announces their quarterly results. The numbers are so good that the buyers are willing to buy the stock at any price on Tuesday morning. This enthusiasm would lead to stock price jumping to Rs.104 directly. This means there was no trading activity between Rs.100 and Rs.104, yet the stock jumped to Rs.104.

However, after the encouraging open, the market/stock does not move and closes by forming a doji/spinning top. The closing on P2 sets in a bit of panic for bullsOn the 3rdday of the pattern (P3), the market opens gap down and progresses into a red candle. The long red candle indicates that the sellers are taking control.

If such a pattern appears and all other checklist items comply i.e volume, S&R, Risk Reward Ratio etc…I would go ahead  and trade this confidently on the merits of an evening star.Replyjagadeeshsays:November 26, 2014 at 9:40 amHello Sir,I am now comfortably able to trade single candlestick patterns and that increased my success ratio  quite well these days. But coming to multiple candlestick patterns, 3 out of 5 trades that i take on multiple candlestick patterns are failing. Is that because i didn’t train my eyes and brain enough to identify them correctly?? Also, does the volume in the P2 and P3 must be higher than the volume in P1 to consider it as a valid pattern??Thanks in advance..ReplyKarthik Rangappasays:November 26, 2014 at 12:36 pmGood to that you are comfortable with single candlestick patterns Jagadeesh. With regard to multiple candlestick pattern, please ensure the day you are taking an action i.e either buying or selling the volume should be above average. Also, one of the main things people miss is to validate the prior trend. So please make sure you are factoring this as well.Replyjagadeeshsays:November 26, 2014 at 2:54 pmYeah im not missing those two checklist points sir. I think i need to train myself in identifying support and resistance levels properly. The thing is, with the appearance of a candlestick pattern, i am totally biasing myself towards the trade direction and searching for the support around that area to support my decision. When the trade ended in loss, im realizing that area is not a major level.. 😀I think i need to change this behaviour. 🙂ReplyKarthik Rangappasays:November 27, 2014 at 5:10 amA trader and a doctor are pretty much similar..the more cases you examine, the better you get at it 🙂Replyjagadeeshsays:November 27, 2014 at 6:31 pmPoint noted sir.. 😀Ashwinsays:November 27, 2014 at 2:56 pmHi Karthik, First comment is to thank you for helping all of us with this. I have read through all the candle sticks over and over agin, but your explanations are state of the art.My question for these kind of patterns is, why can’t a risk lover can take the position at start of the day itself. Why would we wait for the confirmation till EOD. The same for the peircing and other patterns too. I am a bit confused here.Replyjagadeeshsays:November 27, 2014 at 6:35 pmHi Ashwin,Because you cannot cosider the pattern as valid until it completely appears on the chart. I think the main difference between the risk lover and the risk adverse is the former doesn’t need a follow through after the pattern appeared and the risk adverse guy need a follow through after the candle formation. But both these guys need a completed candlestick patter to appear  on the screen which happens at the close of the day.ReplyKarthik Rangappasays:November 28, 2014 at 1:29 amMakes sense Jagadeesh!ReplyAshwinsays:November 29, 2014 at 6:40 pmThanks for the help Jagadeesh! I got the point..Restlessness of the trade doesnt like to miss the golden opportunity..:)ReplyKarthik Rangappasays:November 28, 2014 at 1:19 amThanks Ashwin.Even for risk takers it would be prudent to wait for a confirmation. Think about it, the whole of candlestick patterns is actually based on price action and the markets reaction to it. We should give time for the price action to pan out. Hence for both risk takers risk averse traders it would make sense to wait proportionately (wrt to risk they want to take) ..before initiating a position.ReplyAshwinsays:November 29, 2014 at 6:48 pmThanks again Karthik! I completely understand and appreciate your statement ”Reaction of the market to the price action”,but sometimes due to market volatility and external factors affecting the market as a whole, there wont be any confirmation in the next day,it might become counterproductive for the risk lover,who has initiated the call only at 3.20 PM ,to get a loss the next. So, I am only trying to understand how early any breakouts like this can be capitalized.I have got the essence of both your point and the candle stick pattern, so may be with time and experience I might be able to answer it.ReplyKarthik Rangappasays:December 1, 2014 at 4:58 amAbsolutely, with time, experience, and the knowledge you have gained you will develop your own techniques of identifying markets. In fact in the long run this manifests as your edge as a trader 🙂Replymanishdjk21says:January 8, 2017 at 3:41 pmWhat kind of discipline you’re referring to. like being able to constantly monitor the stock price during the day, keeping your news channel on for any update news or any other livewire news online? I really want to know this because, I’ll tell you something about myself. After working for 6 years in corporate world I Ieft my job in 2014, since then I have been looking for a job but no luck. Now I’ve started to think about making trading as my full time career. Thants why learning TA so that I can make money everyday. My first goal is to earn an avg income of 1 thousand daily by investing 10000 and doing margin trading. please share your thoughts on the same.Karthik Rangappasays:January 9, 2017 at 10:56 amMany people quite their mainstream job to get into trading full time. The problem with this is, moment you put targets like Rs.1000/- per day then you are subconsciously adding a layer of stress on yourself, and when in stress, you cannot make rational decisions which is very crucial while trading. Frankly, the approach you are taking to markets is not correct. You will eventually come under a lot of stress and will find it very hard to benefit from markets. This may sound discouraging, but this is what happens to most of the people in your situation. How ever hard it is maybe, get a full time job, stabilize, and then trade without any sort of pressure (like making 1000 per day). This is when you will really start benefiting from markets.manishdjk21says:January 9, 2017 at 2:42 pmHi Karthik,Thanks for the advise. On the contrary what I’ve experience in the past that it is very difficult and inefficient to do your day job in the office and place your trade, because once a person have placed the trade, then he/she tends to distract from his office work in order to keep a track on the trade and this creates a situation of see-saw where the attention is divided, which not good either. I did search for jobs a lot in the past two years, but no luck as of yet. That’s why I thought why not do trading full time, of course after getting a good understanding giving a time period of 3-6 months.Karthik Rangappasays:January 10, 2017 at 3:27 pmTrue, juggling a full time job and trading gets distracting. But I do know people who manage this well….common trait across all these traders are that they place longer term trades. Something like a 1 week futures position or even equity position.Good luck and I hope you have thought through this well.ZQ0852says:July 8, 2017 at 7:51 pmDear sir,Adding to the MANISH’s query (below), Is it possible to make money in market on daily basis and run your house, means Is it possible to generate a salary type income from trading.RegardsKarthik Rangappasays:July 9, 2017 at 6:12 pmI’ll be frank. Its tough.Have a steady source of income like a salary and trade with capital that does not hurt your family needs. When you trade this way, the stress to make a fixed amount via trading is reduced, which means you can afford to be highly selective and trade only when you are thoroughly convinced.Place your family first, markets next.Good luck.Harshad Salvisays:December 4, 2014 at 6:16 amHi Nitesh,How did you manage to copy the chart of “LT” from icharts?Reply"

Why would we wait for the confirmation till EOD. The same for the peircing and other patterns too. I am a bit confused here."

I think the main difference between the risk lover and the risk adverse is the former doesn’t need a follow through after the pattern appeared and the risk adverse guy need a follow through after the candle formation. But both these guys need a completed candlestick patter to appear  on the screen which happens at the close of the day.ReplyKarthik Rangappasays:November 28, 2014 at 1:29 amMakes sense Jagadeesh!ReplyAshwinsays:November 29, 2014 at 6:40 pmThanks for the help Jagadeesh! I got the point..Restlessness of the trade doesnt like to miss the golden opportunity..:)ReplyKarthik Rangappasays:November 28, 2014 at 1:19 amThanks Ashwin.Even for risk takers it would be prudent to wait for a confirmation. Think about it, the whole of candlestick patterns is actually based on price action and the markets reaction to it. We should give time for the price action to pan out. Hence for both risk takers risk averse traders it would make sense to wait proportionately (wrt to risk they want to take) ..before initiating a position.ReplyAshwinsays:November 29, 2014 at 6:48 pmThanks again Karthik! I completely understand and appreciate your statement ”Reaction of the market to the price action”,but sometimes due to market volatility and external factors affecting the market as a whole, there wont be any confirmation in the next day,it might become counterproductive for the risk lover,who has initiated the call only at 3.20 PM ,to get a loss the next. So, I am only trying to understand how early any breakouts like this can be capitalized.I have got the essence of both your point and the candle stick pattern, so may be with time and experience I might be able to answer it.ReplyKarthik Rangappasays:December 1, 2014 at 4:58 amAbsolutely, with time, experience, and the knowledge you have gained you will develop your own techniques of identifying markets.

The problem with this is, moment you put targets like Rs.1000/- per day then you are subconsciously adding a layer of stress on yourself, and when in stress, you cannot make rational decisions which is very crucial while trading. Frankly, the approach you are taking to markets is not correct. You will eventually come under a lot of stress and will find it very hard to benefit from markets. This may sound discouraging, but this is what happens to most of the people in your situation. How ever hard it is maybe, get a full time job, stabilize, and then trade without any sort of pressure (like making 1000 per day). This is when you will really start benefiting from markets.manishdjk21says:January 9, 2017 at 2:42 pmHi Karthik,Thanks for the advise. On the contrary what I’ve experience in the past that it is very difficult and inefficient to do your day job in the office and place your trade, because once a person have placed the trade, then he/she tends to distract from his office work in order to keep a track on the trade and this creates a situation of see-saw where the attention is divided, which not good either. I did search for jobs a lot in the past two years, but no luck as of yet. That’s why I thought why not do trading full time, of course after getting a good understanding giving a time period of 3-6 months.Karthik Rangappasays:January 10, 2017 at 3:27 pmTrue, juggling a full time job and trading gets distracting. But I do know people who manage this well….common trait across all these traders are that they place longer term trades. Something like a 1 week futures position or even equity position.Good luck and I hope you have thought through this well.ZQ0852says:July 8, 2017 at 7:51 pmDear sir,Adding to the MANISH’s query (below), Is it possible to make money in market on daily basis and run your house, means Is it possible to generate a salary type income from trading.RegardsKarthik Rangappasays:July 9, 2017 at 6:12 pmI’ll be frank.

The problem with this is, moment you put targets like Rs.1000/- per day then you are subconsciously adding a layer of stress on yourself, and when in stress, you cannot make rational decisions which is very crucial while trading. Frankly, the approach you are taking to markets is not correct. You will eventually come under a lot of stress and will find it very hard to benefit from markets. This may sound discouraging, but this is what happens to most of the people in your situation. How ever hard it is maybe, get a full time job, stabilize, and then trade without any sort of pressure (like making 1000 per day). This is when you will really start benefiting from markets."

In case of any event, would i be reimbursed as per both plans. for ex: if company plan cover is 10 lacs and personal plan cover is 20 lacs. Then in case of any treatment, if the bill is 12 lacs then can it be like 10 lacs reimbursed from the company one and 2 lacs from the personal one. Please clarify. Thanks!ReplyAtul @ Dittosays:January 30, 2023 at 12:52 pmHey Abhishek,Yes, you can buy a personal plan even if you have a corporate plan, and that’s also recommended because an individual might switch jobs or take a break where they won’t have coverage from the corporate plan. Coming back to your example, yes, the 10L will be reimbursed from your corporate plan, and you can get the rest from personal health insurance.ReplyParassays:March 16, 2023 at 10:00 pmI wanted to know just asin the case of mutual funds we have Direct and Regular plans,does anything like that we have in insurance?Means are there not any variances in buying the policy directly from the company rather from an agent or broker and if there is does the commission to the entity goes from the customers pocket?Guide for the same.Thanks in advance.ReplyPranavsays:February 6, 2024 at 4:27 pmHey Shrihith, and Team Ditto! Wonderful content and insights on the insurance world. Thank you for doing this.Now let’s suppose I have a cover of 20 lakhs on health insurance and I get hospitalised for a disease/surgery, and 12 lakhs of my cover has been utilised for this hospitalisation. Suppose I am admitted to the hospital once again within a few months in the same calendar year, and this time the bill is more than 8 lakhs, thus exceeding my total cover, will the insurance company reimburse me or do I have to pay the excess amount out of my pocket?ReplyKarthik Rangappasays:February 8, 2024 at 9:52 amPosting this on behalf of Shrehith –Hi Pranav, thanks for reaching out.The answer to your question is a bit subjective, as it depends from plan to plan.There’s a concept, usually called as the restoration benefit. Nowadays, most good health insurance policies offer this benefit free of charge.The restoration benefit simply works to restore the amount used during the first claim. So in your example, after you’ve utilized 12L, it will restore the sum insured back to 20L, by adding 12L back to your plan.Now coming back to your question, if your plan has this restoration benefit and it is allowed to be utilized for any illness, then yes, the health insurance company will cover your second claim up to 20L.Otherwise, if your plan does not have a restoration benefit, then expenses up to 8L will be covered by your plan, and anything over and above 8L will have to be covered from your end.I hope this helps!ReplyRahulsays:January 2, 2025 at 10:33 amHi, can you publish this module in Hindi.

Then in case of any treatment, if the bill is 12 lacs then can it be like 10 lacs reimbursed from the company one and 2 lacs from the personal one. Please clarify. Thanks!"

Coming back to your example, yes, the 10L will be reimbursed from your corporate plan, and you can get the rest from personal health insurance.Reply"

Thank you for doing this.Now let’s suppose I have a cover of 20 lakhs on health insurance and I get hospitalised for a disease/surgery, and 12 lakhs of my cover has been utilised for this hospitalisation. Suppose I am admitted to the hospital once again within a few months in the same calendar year, and this time the bill is more than 8 lakhs, thus exceeding my total cover, will the insurance company reimburse me or do I have to pay the excess amount out of my pocket?"

Nowadays, most good health insurance policies offer this benefit free of charge.The restoration benefit simply works to restore the amount used during the first claim. So in your example, after you’ve utilized 12L, it will restore the sum insured back to 20L, by adding 12L back to your plan.Now coming back to your question, if your plan has this restoration benefit and it is allowed to be utilized for any illness, then yes, the health insurance company will cover your second claim up to 20L.Otherwise, if your plan does not have a restoration benefit, then expenses up to 8L will be covered by your plan, and anything over and above 8L will have to be covered from your end.I hope this helps!Reply"

For example, if Stock A moves 3%, and the correlation between stock A and stock B is +0.75, then it does not mean that Stock B will also move by 3%, all that the correlation suggests is that Stock B will move up positively, just like Stock A."

So in a sense Book Value tells us the strength of the company from a ‘cash’ perspective.Now industries such as capital intensive sectors and financial services are all highly leveraged..(they run on high debt)..so P/B in such circumstances gives a measure of the inherent strength of the company…note the P/B should be viewed along with other ratios to get a complete understanding of the business.Reply"

Can you plz tell how to use trailing stop loss, should it be based on any indicator or manual stop loss.  Require for intraday/ positional. Thanks..ReplyKarthik Rangappasays:November 13, 2014 at 5:28 amFor both intra day and positional it may not be a great idea to base your trailing stop loss based on a typical indicator. It should preferable be based on a preset condition. For example…for every 2% move in your direction you may want to trail the stop loss by 0.5%.Replysriharisays:March 24, 2015 at 4:05 pmSir, can you/anyone please tell me… what is difference between manual stop loss and trailing stop loss :-)…ReplyKarthik Rangappasays:March 25, 2015 at 4:43 amIn fact both Manual stoploss and trainling stoploss are manual….they are two different technique of placing SL. In manual you set a price as your SL. For example if you buy a stock at 100 and you are willing to lose Rs.5 on it, then your manual SL is Rs.5.Trailing SL is when you trail your SL when your trade starts to make a profit. Have explained trailing stoploss here in section 7.5 –http://zerodha.com/varsity/chapter/margin-calculator-part-2/Also, you maybe interested to know that in Zerodha’s Bracket Order type you can automate the trailing stoploss.Replychiragsays:March 12, 2018 at 10:29 amhisuppose my stock is trading at 1185now i get one support at 1150 and other at 1100the priceaction zones line is better in 1100 range than 1150rangeto whom should i take support rangethanksReplyKarthik Rangappasays:March 12, 2018 at 11:27 am1100.ReplyGenesissays:March 30, 2018 at 9:40 pmKarthik, kudos to you!Unbelievably Awesome job at explaining complex stuff in such simple terms….I already feel confident and successful at trading stocks after reading your modules 🙂Can’t wait to put them into practice (of course with my unique Point of View 🙂Thanks a lot for taking time to craft and create these modules – I can see how patient and persistent you are as you’ve repeated some points over and over, so we newbies can digest the sophisticated stock stuff.For me, it’s the best trading educational course that I’ve come across!Really you deserve at least a five minutes standing ovation from all readers here on Varsity, thanks a lot karthik ji 🙂ReplyKarthik Rangappasays:March 31, 2018 at 9:16 amThanks for the very kind words 🙂I’m really happy you find the contents useful.

Remember this is a visual concept, you need to see the support or resistance emerging at a single price point over multiple time periods. Hence its best if you do this manually.Maheshsays:August 14, 2018 at 3:58 pmHow to draw S&R lines manually ?Karthik Rangappasays:August 15, 2018 at 11:36 amHave explained the same in the chapter.

I don’t have any friends to discuss about thisReplyKarthik Rangappasays:November 9, 2018 at 11:11 amPavan, you can post your queries here and I’ll be more than happy to answer.ReplySreekanth Vasusays:November 14, 2014 at 9:27 amDear Sir,In the above first chart , You plotted 215 as the Resistance point , But My doubt goes here ,how you came to that point that chart is resisting at 215. not even 216 or 214 .  Or how i can fix a resistance point . In the said chart  many candles  are traded above 215 i think in chart it shows 240 ranges.  or you confirm it with any candle patterns???ReplyKarthik Rangappasays:November 14, 2014 at 9:59 amAs I mentioned in this chapter, it would not be a wise idea to take a singe price point as a either support or resistance. We should consider the region in and around the price action zone as a S&R. For example if the line coincides with 215, I would  be happy to treat 211 to 218 as either support or resistance.ReplyAnishcharithsays:November 18, 2014 at 1:16 pmsir ,what if a stock is trading at a record high price what is the resistance  ?ReplyKarthik Rangappasays:November 18, 2014 at 1:22 pmWe need to have price history to identify S&R levels. Hence if the stock is trading at an all time high, plotting the resistance is not possible.Replyrajeshck32says:November 20, 2014 at 1:03 pmyou can see the candle stick  patterns being formed  and take the  , next trade  ex if there is a doji   high becomes resistance  , or a pin bar high  becomes resistance .Replychiragsays:March 12, 2018 at 9:49 amhi actally i want to know how we attach file or picture image along with these commentReplyKarthik Rangappasays:March 12, 2018 at 11:26 amYou can upload on Google drive and share the link here.Replyjagadeeshsays:November 24, 2014 at 1:51 pmHi karthik,Ihav come across some charts today where some reversal patterns appear above some previous gaps and reversed.. can i consider previous gaps as supports and resistances..???ReplyKarthik Rangappasays:November 24, 2014 at 4:17 pmI personally don’t like to considered gaps as a price action zone and hence prefer to avoid gaps for S&R considerations… but thats just me :). I would suggest you dig up more price history to evaluate the presence of historical price action around the gap price level.ReplyViveksays:July 10, 2015 at 4:46 pmHi Karthik, Thanks for the lucid explanation. Would you let me know,while plotting S&R for Intraday trading, 3-6 months of EOD data or any other time frame data(like 15 min. data of 3-6 months) to be taken into consideration.? Thanks.ReplyKarthik Rangappasays:July 12, 2015 at 3:39 amFor intraday I would suggest you plot the S&R on 15 mins candle with a look back period of at least 2 weeks (10 trading sessions).ReplySinghsays:November 24, 2017 at 10:40 amSir, your explanations are very helpful and informative as i am new to trading. Can we apply this 2 week R&S method for both Equity-Cash trade and Stock Future also?Karthik Rangappasays:November 24, 2017 at 3:20 pmYes, you can certainly do this!Davesays:July 19, 2018 at 5:43 pmHi Karthik Rangappa,In case of swing trade shall I select 1D time frame of (3-6) months or shall I select some other time frame?The reason I asking this question again is because, I am finding challenging to find few specific S&R in the time frame of (3-6 Months) by keeping 1D time frame.Appreciate any of the community member feedback. ThanksKarthik Rangappasays:July 20, 2018 at 12:27 pm1D is good, Dave. To plot the S&R, you can even increase the time frame to over 6 months. This should not pose any problem."

The stationarity of the residuals is checked by many tests one of them is Augmented Dicky-Fuller test. The o/p of ADF test is in terms of probability. The threshold value (p-value) is 0.05 or 5%. The lower the probability value  the more securities will be co-integrated.Here is the link for EViews software:http://www.eviews.com/home.htmlThanks.ReplyKarthik Rangappasays:May 13, 2018 at 11:39 amHey Mayank, thanks for sharing the link.
